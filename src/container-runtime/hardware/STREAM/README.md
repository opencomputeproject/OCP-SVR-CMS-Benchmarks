# How to
 
Ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites installed, see root of this directory for instructions. 

make a runtime directory for the benchmark, jump into it, and make a runtime output directory

```bash
mkdir -p container-benchmark
cd container-benchmark
mkdir -p my-output-directory 
```
copy EDITME.env as .env and edit the configurable fields for your desired system under test, and cp over the docker-compose.yml file. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE YOU WILL INVALIDATE THE TESTING. 

```bash
cp ../EDITME.env .env
cp ../docker-compose.yml .
vim .env
```

Then run the benchmark
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
