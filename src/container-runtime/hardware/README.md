# CMS Hardware Benchmarks

These benchmarks are designed to baseline system performance with straightforward latency and bandwidth measurements. These tests will add configuration for more complicated topologies as the effort and the technology matures. Presently, these tests are designed to test performance of singular devices under test, _e.g._ a direct attached CXL device, a CXL pool endpoint, _etc._ which are bound to their nearest socket. 

Future goals will impact CXL and DRAM interleave configurations, auto-tiering schemes, _etc._
